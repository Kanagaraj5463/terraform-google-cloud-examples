# Terraform examples on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more. Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform.

This repo contains [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) code examples on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

The Github repository
[https://github.com/alfonsof/terraform-examples-aws](https://github.com/alfonsof/terraform-examples-aws)
contains the code samples based in the book *[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* by [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com). But those examples use AWS (Amazon Web Services).

Terraform also supports other Cloud providers and this Github repository contains the code samples of the book on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
